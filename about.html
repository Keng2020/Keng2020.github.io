            <h2>My Educational Background</h2>
            <p>I completed my Master's degree in Civil Engineering, specializing in the Geotechnical Division, at National Taiwan University (NTU), where I focused on identifying horizontal auto-correlation parameters using inclined cone penetration tests under the guidance of Prof. Jianye Ching. Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering from National Taipei University of Technology (NTUT), engaging in a project on the programming and verification of limit equilibrium slope stability analysis using MATLAB.</p>
            
            <h2>Projects and Contributions</h2>
            <p>During my academic career, I have been involved in various projects, including the development of a MATLAB tool for slope stability analysis and an automated tool for downloading and processing Cone Penetration Test (CPT) records from the New Zealand Geotechnical Database (NZGD), which significantly improved data processing efficiency.</p>
